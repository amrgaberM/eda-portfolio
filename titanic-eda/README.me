# Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains a beginner-level exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Objective
Understand the characteristics and patterns in the Titanic dataset to identify factors that influenced passenger survival.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Data includes demographic and travel information of passengers.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**
   - Checked data types, missing values, and basic structure.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`, and dropped `Cabin`.
   - Removed duplicates.

3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Analyzed distributions of individual features using histograms, boxplots, and bar charts.

4. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Explored relationships between features and the target (`Survived`).
   - Focused on `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Age`, `Fare`, and `Embarked`.

5. **Outlier Detection**
   - Used IQR method to detect and handle outliers in `Fare` and `Age`.

6. **Key Insights**
   - Gender and class had a strong impact on survival.
   - Children and passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive.
   - Traveling alone decreased survival chances.
